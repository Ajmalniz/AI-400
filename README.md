# AI-400: Cloud-Native AI — Learn Dapr, Docker & Kubernetes with AIDD

This repository contains my progress and work for the **AI-400** course from Panaversity.

**Course Page:** [AI-400 - Cloud-Native AI](https://panaversity.org/flagship-program/courses/AI-400)

## Course Overview

**Cloud-Native AI** teaches you how to build cloud infrastructure for AI agents using Specification-Driven Development and AI-Driven Development (AIDD). You'll learn to take AI projects from local experiments to production-grade systems that scale automatically, recover gracefully, and run anywhere.

**Duration:** 3 months  
**Prerequisites:** AI-300 (AI-Driven Development with Python and Agentic AI)

## Course Description

The way we build and run AI is changing. It's no longer just about running agents on your laptop—it's about deploying intelligent systems that live and scale in the cloud. Cloud-Native AI gives you the skills to take your AI projects from local experiments to production-grade systems.

In this course, you'll learn how to build cloud infrastructure for AI agents using Specification-Driven Development and AI-Driven Development (AIDD). You'll start with FastAPI and Docker, packaging your applications into portable containers. Then move to Kubernetes, learning how to run and manage those containers at scale. Finally, you'll explore Dapr, the layer that makes your AI systems cloud-agnostic, with built-in support for state management, pub/sub messaging, and service communication.

## Key Learning Modules

### Module 1: Foundations: Cloud Native Infrastructure for AI
- Master Context Engineering to structure AI collaboration for infrastructure design
- Partner with Claude Code to understand containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and cloud-agnostic abstractions (Dapr)
- Learn Spec-Driven Development (SDD) fundamentals
- Establish professional thinking patterns for production deployment

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

---

### Module 2: Docker Fundamentals: Containerizing AI Applications
- Containerize FastAPI services using Docker with AIDD and SDD
- Multi-stage builds, Python dependencies, layer optimization
- Master container networking, health checks, and Docker Compose for local development
- Focus on specification and validation, not Dockerfile syntax memorization

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

---

### Module 3: Kubernetes Basics: Orchestrating Agent Systems
- Orchestrate agent systems on Kubernetes with AIDD and SDD using kubectl-ai and kagent
- Specify deployment requirements—pods, services, ConfigMaps, StatefulSets
- Master Kubernetes primitives through specifications
- Event-driven patterns with Kafka and production-grade configurations

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

---

### Module 4: DAPR Core: Cloud-Agnostic Abstractions
- Implement Dapr Core and Dapr Workflows for cloud-agnostic communication and long-running processes
- Specify requirements—state stores, pub/sub, service invocation, durable workflows
- Master cloud-portable patterns: state works with any database, pub/sub with any broker
- Write once, deploy anywhere

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

---

### Module 5: Production Operations: Observability, Scaling & CI/CD
- Build production-ready AI systems using SDD for operations and monitoring
- Specify observability requirements—OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, cost dashboards
- Master autoscaling, CI/CD with Testcontainers and GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

---

## Course Outcomes

Upon completion, I will be able to:

- ✅ Apply Context Engineering to structure effective AI collaboration for infrastructure design
- ✅ Partner with Claude Code to generate production-ready cloud configurations from specifications
- ✅ Master Spec-Driven Development (SDD) to design infrastructure through clear intent, not manual YAML
- ✅ Containerize AI applications with Docker using AIDD and SDD for multi-stage builds and optimization
- ✅ Orchestrate agent systems on Kubernetes with AIDD and SDD using kubectl-ai and kagent
- ✅ Implement Dapr Core and Dapr Workflows for cloud-agnostic state, pub/sub, and long-running processes
- ✅ Build observable, scalable AI systems with OpenTelemetry, autoscaling, and automated CI/CD pipelines

## Skills Development & Learning Notes

### Skill Design Best Practices

**Key Principle:** Use progressive disclosure with domain-specific organization for complex skills.

**Example - E-commerce Skill Structure:**
```
ecommerce/
├── SKILL.md (overview, workflow, navigation)
└── references/
    ├── products.md (catalog, inventory, categories)
    ├── cart.md (shopping cart, session management)
    ├── orders.md (order processing, fulfillment)
    ├── payments.md (payment gateways, transactions)
    ├── users.md (authentication, profiles, addresses)
    ├── shipping.md (delivery, tracking, zones)
    └── admin.md (dashboard, analytics, management)
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines (concise is key)
- Use one skill for cohesive domains (e.g., e-commerce as one system)
- Split complex domains into reference files (loaded only when needed)
- Separate skills only if truly independent (different deployment cycles/teams)

**Skills to Build:**
- [ ] E-commerce development skill (planned)
- [ ] _(Add more skills as they come up)_
